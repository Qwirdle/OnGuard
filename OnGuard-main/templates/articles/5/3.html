	On the internet, all data must be handled carefully. The problem with data, however, is that by making something more secure, you compromise other aspects of it.

</p>

<p> 
	This is called the <b>“CIA Triad”</b>. It consists of 3 components:</b>

</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Confidentiality</b></p>
        <ul><li><p>The guarantee that only people meant to see it will</p></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Integrity</b></p>
        <ul><li><p>The guarantee that the data will remain unchanged</p></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><b>Availability</b></p>
        <ul><li><p>The guarantee that the data will be available at any given moment</p></li></ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p> 
	It is <i>completely unrealistic to completely fill even one of these parts of the triad</i>. To make it perfectly confidential you would need to meet up somewhere secret and 
    exchange SSDs of data physically. To raise its integrity, you would need to make it so no one could ever switch or modify any contents. Finally, to make it available to 
    all, a QR code that links to a separate download link (in case one goes down) must be placed at every lamp post in the world.

</p>

<p>The realistic tradeoffs for each type, however, are that:</p>

<ul>    
    <li><p>If data must be confidential, it should be <b>encrypted</b> and locked behind passwords or accounts, removing availability. This may also remove integrity since some encryption 
        ciphers completely change data if even one character is changed.</p></li>     
    <li><p>If the data must be available, it will sacrifice confidentiality due to how easy it will be to find, and integrity because hackers would be more likely to find 
        vulnerabilities.</p></li> 
    <li><p>If the data must not be changed, it will need multiple <b>backups</b> and confirmations before changes, which would take much storage and remove both availability 
        and confidentiality</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Follow the CIA Triad</p>
        <ul><li><p><i>Every</i> bit of data needs at least <i>some</i> of each element to not make it unworkable</p></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Most data will need medium to high levels of encryption. This includes</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Passwords</p></li>
            <li><p>Medical records</p></li>
            <li><p>Many documents/contracts</p></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>Attempting to fill out everything in the CIA Triad is unrealistic</p></li>
</ul>
