	Workers are still human, and mistakes will always happen regardless of how trained they are.

</p>
<p>After being subjected to an incident, one should report it immediately, be it social engineering, phishing, or even something more traditional like getting your 
    wallet stolen and it had a keycard inside.</p>

<p><b>Incidents of large scale that can compromise public health, national security, or economic security should be reported to the relevant authorities.</b></p>

<p>Below are different ways (vectors) cybersecurity attacks may happen</p>

<p>Early reporting is the best way to stop further damages from occurring, never mind the fact that hiding such incidentâ€™s occurrences will likely get you fired 
    or even your company fined.</p>

<p>Confidential data is illegal to share publicly. This is called a data breach and is sometimes an example of <b>breach of contract.</b></p>

<p>Always escalate. An office worker can rarely fix the damages they can cause, nevermind do it quickly enough to stop damages.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Always report incidents if you are aware of them</p></li>
    <li><p>Employees may be fired if they don't report incidents</p></li>
    <li><p>Escalate, be it to IT or if the breach is dangerous, to emergency services. Issues like this are typically best handled by professionals</p></li>
</ul>
