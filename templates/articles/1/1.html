<h2>1.1 Importance of Cybersecurity in the Workplace</h2>
<p> The first thing to understand when it comes to the importance of cybersecurity in the workplace is that the 
    <b>employees, like you, are the weakest link in the company's cybersecurity.</b> This is because while computers 
    and servers can be set up to be secure using software and configuration, people can’t be, at least not in a surefire way 
    like that. This is because we are humans, and we make mistakes, but when it comes to your cybersecurity, these mistakes 
    can cause both major harm to yourself, but also the company you work for. However, this course aims to educate and train 
    you in order to be more secure, so that hackers and criminals can’t exploit you.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, “I don’t need to worry about cybersecurity, I’m not someone of importance in my workplace”, but you 
    could not be more wrong. <b>As an employee, you almost always have a good amount of access to your company's data and systems, 
    and this is what hackers and criminals want.</b> Many companies have been brought down by crippling cyber attacks, which is happening 
    more and more over the years as the world becomes more integrated into technology, and this means that cyberattacks are becoming more 
    and more of a threat. This is why it is of the utmost importance that you know how to stay secure.</p>
<p>t’s also important to note that you won’t just be at risk from malware going through your system within itself, but there are intricate 
    types of attacks like Phishing that more directly or sometimes directly communicate with you through email, phone calls, or other methods 
    in order to trick you into giving hackers and criminals access to your company’s data. <b>The umbrella term for this is sort of psychological 
    attack is called social engineering.</b></p>
