    safety. <b>If you do not maintain secure browsing habits, data theft, malicious attacks, data theft, and many 
    other events can occur that could cause harm.</b> The following are good habits to keep in mind while browsing the internet:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Use Trusted Websites:</b>Check the urls you are using to access sites with to make sure that they are the

    <li><p><b>Don't Interact wih Suspicious Links or Ads: </b>Don’t interact with pop-ups or advertisements that seem to be too 
        good to be true. <b>In fact, generally one shouldn’t interact with any sort of advertisements because of the immense 
        amount of malicious ones on the internet.</b> Also make sure to not interact with suspicious links, which can appear 
        anywhere.</p></li> 
    <li><p><b>Update your Web Browser and Extensions: </b>Though this is generally done automatically nowadays, <b>keeping 
        your browsing software updated makes sure they are as secure as they can be.</b></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Use Strong Passwords: Strong passwords are one of the primary defenses against malicious actors,</b>
        which is why one should maintain them. Additionally, using <b>multi-factor authentication can strongly increase 
        your credential security.</b></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Use Browser Security Features: Your browser comes with many security features in the settings, </b>
        make sure to check these to see if everything is turned on. Additionally, you can get <b>browser extensions 
        like ad-blockers that can help combat suspicious advertisements.</b></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Be Careful when Downloading:  Make sure to only download files from places that you can trust, and also 
        scan these downloads to make sure they are safe.</b>Never download anything that either looks suspicious or 
        sources from something suspicious.</p></li>
