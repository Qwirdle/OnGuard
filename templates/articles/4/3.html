	Public Wi-Fi, although easily accessible, carries many risks. <b>Cyber criminals can easily commit acts of data theft, malware, and gain unauthorized 
    access to you or any organizations you are a part of through public wifi</b>. Although it is very commonly done and easy to connect to public Wi-Fi, 
    doing so is something that one should quit to avoid unnecessary consequences, at least without using proper tools.

</p>

<p> 
	Many cyber attacks are done over public Wi-Fi networks. The ease of access to other devices allows cyber criminals to decrypt user traffic like texts, 
    among other attacks. Cyber criminals <b>can even set up fake public networks in order to trick people</b> into connecting into networks where the criminals 
    can then easily access the victims data from. <b>One common attack committed over public Wi-Fi networks is a man in the middle attack, where a third party 
    intercepts a message being sent between two computers,</b> usually for malicious reasons.</b>

</p>

<p> 
	Despite all this, there are some countermeasures one can take when using public Wi-Fi to mitigate these risks:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><p><b>Use Virtual Private Network's (VPN's): </b>VPNs <b></b>encrypt one’s internet traffic,</b> making it harder for anyone other than you to access. Many free and paid 
        ones exist, though double <b>check with your IT department before installing one on a work device.</b></p></li>
        
    <li><p><b>Don’t interact with sensitive data: </b>Avoid logging into important accounts, or responding to important emails on public wifi network as you never know 
        if someones watching.</p></li> 
    <li><p><b>Turn off file sharing: </b>File sharing on public wifi networks <b>could allow for cyber criminals to have easy access to your files.</b></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Don’t setup automatic connection to public networks: You never want to be unknowingly connected to a public WiFi network</b>because of the potential dangers, 
        which can be hindered by activating automatic connection to a public network because then connection will happen without you knowing.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Verify Network Authenticity: </b>Ask a venews clerk if a public network is the one that belongs to that store, as sometimes <b>cyber criminals set up fake public 
        networks to mimic that of venus in order to attract potential victims.</b></p></li>
    <li><p><b>Maintain basic security: </b>Keeping your system updated, login secured, and following the other important steps towards maintaining basic security that are 
        described in this course create an important buffer against cybercrime in most if not all situations.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p>Public Wi-Fi poses risks like data theft, malware, and unauthorized access.</p></li>
    <li><p>Use a VPN to encrypt traffic.</p></li>
    <li><p>Avoid sensitive transactions and turn off file sharing.</p></li>
    <li><p>Disable automatic connections and verify network authenticity.</p></li>
    <li><p>Keep devices updated and maintain strong security practices.</p></li>
